# Instructions

The following instructions assume that the python package virtualenvwrapper is already installed, and that the 'python' command points to a Python 3 interpreter.

## Installation

Before doing anything else, create a virtual environment to run the programs in, and install the required packages:

```
mkvirtualenv <your environment name here>
cd <coding challenge code directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the first task (display board)

```
cd <coding challenge code directory>
python 1_show.py <FEN string>
```

## Running the second task (make suggested move)

```
cd <coding challenge code directory>
python 2_move.py <FEN string>
```

## Running stretch code (combined), if implemented

```
cd <coding challenge code directory>
python stretch.py <FEN string>
```
